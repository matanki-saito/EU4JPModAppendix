Each are subject to each other, but the Doge sits at the top of the hierarchy. Our loose government system has been useful thus far in advancing our trade efforts, but as our nation expands across the world, it’s become clear that we must grant the Doge executive powers across all branches of the government if we are to eliminate corruption in our administration."
